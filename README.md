# Kanka-API-Client

My attempt at creating an API client for the worldbuilding software kanka.io. pykanka currently  provides get/post/patch functionality  as well as classes for the different entity types found on Kanka. A basic documentation is available through the wiki, here: https://github.com/thatGuySpectre/pykanka/wiki

Both this module and the Kanka API itself are prone to changes, so I cannot guarantee stability.

For questions and issues I can be contacted as Spectre#9477 on discord.

I am in no way affiliated with Kanka or its developers.

Have fun :D
